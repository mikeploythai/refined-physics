## Refined Physics v1.0-beta1.2

- Removed air deceleration when spin charging in the air, making it the definitive drop dash for this mod
- It now takes 8 spin charges to dash away at full speed instead of 5

## Refined Physics v1.0-beta1.1

- Decreased boost gauge consumption during spin dash from 50 to 25
- Re-balanced initial spin boost speed

## Refined Physics v1.0-beta

- Added configuration UI
- Public beta release ðŸŽ‰

## Refined Physics v1.0-alpha.4

- General refactoring of codes
- Split ground and air deceleration codes into 2
- Added code for more challenging parry
- Rebalanced air boost
- Increased wall-running brake force
- Spin boost speed increases if power boost is active
- Added code for faster boost consumption

## Refined Physics v1.0-alpha.3

- Reworked mod to use HMM codes rather than modifying playercommon.pac
  - This means it's compatible with other physics/combat mods _in theory_, as my values would overwrite the other mods if placed above them (I think idrk)
- Set up update server properly this time lol

## Refined Physics v1.0-alpha.2

- Made boost gauge recovery rate faster
- Rebalanced air boost
- Decreased light speed dash brake resistance
- Decreased minimum slide speed
- Modified spin boost max speed and deceleration
- Made spin boost flinging better

## Refined Physics v1.0-alpha

- Sonic's deceleration has been drastically reduced; his speed cap is practically gone, allowing the player to gain speed running downhill without boost
- Sonic's falling deceleration has been drastically reduced as well
- Grinding has a lower minimum speed, and deceleration has been reduced to let Sonic gain/lose speed when going upwards/downwards on a rail
- The boost gauge now depletes within 2 seconds or so, making the boost more of a dash ability now
- The air boost now acts similarly to Sonic Generations
- Max parry time has been reduced to 0.3s so it could be more challenging
- The lightspeed dash no longer brings Sonic to a halt after dashing through a trail
- Letting go of the boost while wall running no longer brings Sonic to an instant halt
