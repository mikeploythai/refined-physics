# Refined Physics for Sonic Frontiers üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I like the vanilla physics of Sonic Frontiers, but the most annoying thing about it is when I let go of RT when power boosting, and Sonic practically loses all his prior speed. The inital goal was to create a mod that addresses that singular issue, but here I am.. with yet another physics mod.

I know, I know. It's an oversaturated mod niche for this game, but the thing that's bothered me about all the other physics mods is that it deviates a bit too much from the vanilla feel. Some have Sonic's base running speed at a crazy high amount, some make it a bit way too difficult for Sonic to simply walk up a hill, and some just simply don't feel 100% to my liking. I want to modify the movement as minimally as possible, and focus on refining what's already good (with some extras sprinkled in).

## Changes üîµ

> Players can opt-in or out of any changes I made through the configuration menu!

<details>
  <summary><b>Decreased Ground Deceleration</b></summary>

  Decreases Sonic's deceleration on ground, allowing him to gain speed naturally without boosting and to prevent instant momentum loss after boosting/power boosting.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Decreased Falling Deceleration</b></summary>

  Decreases Sonic's deceleration in air, allowing him to retain his forward momentum while falling uncurled.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Momentum Rails</b></summary>

  Makes rails more momentum-based, allowing Sonic to gain/decrease speed when going up/down rails.

  Additionally, the minimum rail grinding speed has been decreased, and maximum rail speed is increased.
  
  This does NOT remove Sonic's minimum rail speed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Generations-Styled Air Boost</b></summary>

  Makes the air boost act similar to the one in Sonic Generations.

  Keep `Decreased Falling Deceleration` enabled for a better air boosting experience.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Brake Easing for Wall Running</b></summary>

  Makes Sonic ease into a stop when letting go of the boost button while wall running.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Decreased Minimum Slide Speed</b></summary>

  Decreases the minimum sliding speed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Softer Light Speed Dash Brake</b></summary>

  Prevents Sonic from coming to an instant stop after light speed dashing.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Easier Incline Jumps</b></summary>

  Makes incline jumps easier.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Better Spin Boost</b></summary>

  Inspired by Weezley's [Legacy Spin Dash mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/462772)!

  Spin boost is now momentum-based.

  Spin boosting without charging retains Sonic's prior forward momentum, making it act like a normal roll.
  
  Spin charging on the ground determines how fast the spin boost is after releasing the charge. 5 charges = max speed.
  
  In the air, the longer the player holds the spin charge button, the faster the resulting spin boost will be once Sonic hits the ground.
  
  Flinging off a platform while spin boosting is now much smoother (I think).

  Spin charging mid-air doesn't bring Sonic to an awkward halt! This make it the definitive way to perform a drop dash with this mod.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Faster Boost Consumption</b></summary>

  Since Sonic can retain his momentum better in Refined Physics, there's no need for him to boost for a long time.

  Additionally, I wanted to explore how boost and spin dash can co-exist without one losing purpose due the other.
  
  IMO: the boost should be a method to gain speed quickly, with the trade-off that Sonic remains vulnerable and it takes more energy. The spin dash should be a method to both gain speed and attack enemies that takes less energy, with the trade-off that the player must charge it.
  
  Credits to Proto's [Cyberspace Overhaul mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/430615) for inspiring me to explore this boost-as-dash idea many, many months ago. LexStorm's awesome [High Speed Style mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/464066) explores the idea as well!

<details>
  <summary><b>Harder Parry</b></summary>

  Not really physics-related, but I added it anyway lmao

  Makes the parry last 0.3s instead of 15s.

## Development üíª

Here are the resouces I used to develop this project!

- [HedgeArcPack CLI tool by Radfordhound](https://github.com/HedgeDocs/HedgeDocs.github.io/releases) to unpack/repack the `playercommon.pac` file from the game itself. This file holds a bunch of shit related to the character mechanics.
- [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) to edit the hex code within the `player_common.rfl` file, which you get from unpacking `playercommon.pac`. The RFL file contains hex code for Sonic's movement, combat, etc.
- [`SonicParameters.bt` RFL template by Skyth](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/RflTemplates/blob/master/SonicFrontiers/Uncategorized/SonicParameters.bt) to actually modify `player_common.rfl` without having to figure out which hex codes do what and making me lose my god damn braincells
- [HedgeDocs](https://hedgedocs.com) as have some sort of guide to figure out wtf to do (I still have no idea what I'm doing lmao)
- [Tracker's Physics Tweaks](https://gamebanana.com/mods/415617) to see what parameters are modified to figure out what to actually mess with in `player_common.rfl`. Cool physics mod btw!
- [Legacy Spin Dash by Weezley](https://gamebanana.com/mods/462772) to figure out how creating HMM codes work, and to figure out how to implement charging for the vanilla spin charge. Great spin dash mod!
- [`SonicFrontiers.hmm` from the HedgeModManager repo](https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager/blob/rewrite/HedgeModManager/Resources/Codesv2/SonicFrontiers.hmm) to find the methods and libraries I needed to write my `spinboost.hmm` code
- [Sonic Unleashed Sweepkick by Loco](https://gamebanana.com/mods/461751) to learn how to integrate configuration in a HMM code mod.

***

Literally shout out to [HyperBE32](https://github.com/HyperBE32), Weezley, [Radfordhound](https://github.com/Radfordhound), [Tracker](https://github.com/TrackerTD), and everyone involved with creating the resources I used. Without them, none of this would be possible.
