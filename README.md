# Chargable Vanilla Spin Dash

This is modified code from my Refined Physics mod! It's basically the vanilla physics, but adapted to take charging into consideration. If you want something that's momentum-based, with extra features, and with updates, then consider checking out Refined Physics.

It's heavily recommended to enable the `Always Unlocked Spin Dash`, `Disable Spin Charge Camera`, and `Disable Drop Dash` codes in HMM.

## Gameplay Changes

- Spin Dash: Charging now determines how fast Sonic dashes away. 8 charges = max speed.
- "New" Drop Dash: However long the player holds LT before Sonic lands on the ground determines how fast he'll dash away. Additionally, Sonic no longer awkwardly loses momentum if you decide to charge a drop dash after running and jumping.
- "New" Roll: Holding LT while moving no longer makes Sonic dash away with an instant boost of speed. Rather, the initial rolling speed is determined by how fast Sonic was moving prior.

The OG code and this code is heavily inspired by Weezley and their Legacy Spin Dash Mod! I really just wanted a mod exactly like theirs, but for the vanilla spin dash lol
