# Reduced Ground Deceleration for Sonic Frontiers üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I like the vanilla physics of Sonic Frontiers, but holy shit the most annoying thing about it is when I let go of RT when power boosting, and Sonic practically loses all his prior speed. This fixes that WITHOUT modifying anything else in the physics.

This code was taken from my WIP "Refined Physics" mod, which you can check out in the [`main` branch](https://github.com/mploythai/refined-physics/tree/main)
